title: Configuring Pivotal Cloud Foundry SSL Termination for vSphere Deployments
owner: Ops Manager

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

To use SSL termination in [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF), you must
configure the Pivotal-deployed HAProxy load balancer or your own load balancer.

Pivotal recommends that you use HAProxy in lab and test environments only.
Production environments should instead use a highly-available customer-provided
load balancing solution.

Select an SSL termination method to determine the steps you must take to
configure Pivotal Application Service (PAS).

##<a id="haproxy"></a>Using the Pivotal HAProxy Load Balancer##

PCF deploys with a single instance of HAProxy for use in lab and test
environments.
You can use this HAProxy instance for SSL termination and load balancing to the
PCF Routers.
HAProxy can generate a self-signed certificate if you do not want to obtain a
signed certificate from a well-known certificate authority.
<%= partial '../customizing/known-issue-self-signed-certs' %>

To use the HAProxy load balancer, you must create a wildcard A record in your
DNS and configure three fields in the PAS product tile.

1. Create an A record in your DNS that points to the HAProxy IP address. The A
record associates the **System Domain** and **Apps Domain** that you configure
in the **Domains** section of the PAS tile with the HAProxy IP address.
    <br />
    <br />
    For example, with `cf.example.com` as the main subdomain for your CF install
	and an HAProxy IP address `203.0.113.1`, you must create an A record in your
	DNS that serves `example.com` and points `*.cf` to `203.0.113.1`.

    <table >
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Data</th>
			<th>Domain</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>*.cf</td>
		    <td>A</td>
		    <td>203.0.113.1</td>
		    <td>example.com</td>
        </tr>
	</table>

1. Use the Linux `host` command to test your DNS entry. The `host` command
should return your HAProxy IP address.
	<br />
	<br />
	Example:
	<pre class='terminal'>
	$ host cf.example.com
    cf.example.com has address 203.0.113.1
	$ host anything.example.com
    anything.cf.example.com has address 203.0.113.1
	</pre>

1. From the PCF Ops Manager Dashboard, click on the PAS tile.

1. Select **Networking**.

1. Leave the **Router IPs** field blank. HAProxy assigns the router IPs internally.

1. Enter the IP address for HAProxy in the **HAProxy IPs** field.

1. Provide your SSL certificate in the **SSL Termination Certificate and Private Key** field. See [Providing a Certificate for your SSL Termination Point](./security_config.html#config) for details.

##<a id="other"></a>Using Another Load Balancer##

Production environments should use a highly-available customer-provided load
balancing solution that does the following:

* Provides SSL termination with wildcard DNS location
* Provides load balancing to each of the PCF Router IPs
* Adds appropriate `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` HTTP headers

You must register static IP addresses for PCF with your load balancer and
configure three fields in the PAS product tile.

1. Register one or more static IP address for PCF with your load
balancer.

1. Create an A record in your DNS that points to your load balancer IP address.
The A record associates the **System Domain** and **Apps Domain** that you
configure in the **Domains** section of the PAS tile with the IP address of
your load balancer.
    <br />
    <br />
    For example, with `cf.example.com` as the main subdomain for your CF install
    and a load balancer IP address `198.51.100.1`, you must create an A record in
	your DNS that serves `example.com` and points `*.cf` to `198.51.100.1`.

    <table border="1" class="nice" >
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
			  <th>Type</th>
			  <th>Data</th>
			  <th>Domain</th>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>*.cf</td>
		    <td>A</td>
		    <td>198.51.100.1</td>
		    <td>example.com</td>
      </tr>
    </table>


1. From the PCF Ops Manager Dashboard, click on the PAS tile.

1. Select **Networking**.

1. In the **Router IPs** field, enter the static IP address for PCF that you have registered with your load balancer.

1. Leave the **HAProxy IPs** field blank.

1. Provide your SSL certificate in the **SSL Termination Certificate and Private Key** field. See [Providing a Certificate for your SSL Termination Point](./security_config.html#config) for details.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: When adding or removing PCF routers, you must update your load balancing solution configuration with the appropriate IP addresses.</p>
