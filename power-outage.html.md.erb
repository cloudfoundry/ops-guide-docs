title: Checking PCF State after a Power Failure on vSphere
owner:
---

This topic describes how to check Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) state after a power failure in an on-premises vSphere installation. If you have a procedure at your company for handling power failure scenarios and would like add steps for checking that PCF is in a good state, you can use this procedure as a template.  

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview  

PCF uses [BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs) to deploy and manage its VMs. When power returns after a failure and vSphere HA has recovered VMs, BOSH automatically acts to ensure the processes on those VMs are healthy, with the exception of the Ops Manager VM. Additionally, the [Diego](../concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html) runtime of Pivotal Application Service (PAS) recovers apps that were running on the VMs. 

While PCF on vSphere can automatically recover from a power failure, there are two scenarios that can require manual intervention:

* If PAS is configured to use a MySQL cluster instead of a single node, the cluster does not recover automatically. 
* If you have Ops Manager v2.5.3 or earlier and encounter the following known issue in the BOSH Director: [Monit inaccurately reports the health of UAA](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#monit). 

Use the checklist in the following section to ensure PCF is in a good state after a power outage. 

### <a id="checklist"></a> Checklist  

This checklist assumes your PCF on vSphere installation is set up for vSphere HA and you have the BOSH Resurrector enabled.

## <a id="check-vSphere"></a> Phase 1: Ensure vSphere is Running

Ensure that vSphere is running and has fully recovered from the power failure. Check your internal vSphere monitoring dashboard. 

## <a id="check-vcenter"></a> Phase 2: Ensure Ops Manager is Running

1. Open vCenter and navigate to the resource pool that hosts your PCF deployment.

1. Select the **Related Objects** tab, and then **Virtual Machines**. 

1. Locate the VM with the name `OpsMan-VERSION`, such as `OpsMan-2.6`. 

1. Review the **State** and **Status** columns for the Ops Manager VM. If Ops Manager is running, they say **Powered On** and **Normal**. If this is not the case, restart the VM. 

## <a id="check-bosh"></a> Phase 3: Ensure BOSH Director is Running

1. In a browser, navigate to the PCF Ops Manager UI and select the **BOSH Director for vSphere** tile. 
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not know the URL of the Ops Manager VM, you can use the IP address from vCenter.</p>

1. Select the **Status** tab. 

1. Record the **CID**, or container ID, of the **BOSH Director** job. 

1. Navigate to the vCenter resource pool that hosts your PCF deployment.

1. Select the **Related Objects** tab, and then **Virtual Machines**.

1. Locate the VM with the name that corresponds to the **CID** value you copied. 

1. Review the **State** and **Status** columns for the VM. 

1. If the **State** is not **Powered On**, restart the VM. 

1. If the VM is **Powered On** but **Status** does not display **Normal**, it may be due to the known issue where [Monit inaccurately reports the health of UAA](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#monit). To resolve this issue, do the following:
	1. Follow these instructions to [SSH into the BOSH Director VM](../customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-director-ssh). 
	1. Run `monit summary` to see that all processes are running. 
	1. If the `uaa` process is not running, run `monit restart UAA`. 

## <a id="resurrector"></a> Phase 4: Ensure BOSH Resurrector Finished Recovering

If enabled, the BOSH Resurrector re-creates any VMs in a problematic state after being recovered by vSphere HA. 

1. Follow the instructions to [Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](../customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh). 

1. Follow the instructions to [Authenticate with the BOSH Director VM](../customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in). 

1. Run  `bosh tasks --all -d ''` to see if there are any currently running or queued Resurrector activity. Look for `scan` and `fix` in the task description. If there are no tasks running, it is likely that BOSH Director has finished recovering. You can also run `bosh tasks --recent --all -d ''` to view finished tasks.

## <a id="check-pas"></a> Phase 5: Ensure PAS VMs are Running

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have PCF service tiles installed, such as Redis for PCF, you can use the steps in this section to also check the VMs for those services. To further ensure the health of any PCF services installed, use the PCF Healthwatch dashboard and the documentation for each service.</p>

1. Run `bosh vms` to confirm that VMs are running. BOSH lists VMs by deployment. The deployment with the `cf-` prefix is the PAS deployment. 
.

1. If the `mysql` VM is not running, it is likely because it is a cluster and not a single node. Clusters require manual intervention after an outage. See [Manually Recover PAS MySQL (Clusters Only)](#check-mysql) to confirm and recover the cluster. 

1. If any other VMs are not running, run `bosh cck -d DEPLOYMENT`. This command scans for problems and provides options for recovering VMs. For more information, see [IaaS Reconciliation](https://bosh.io/docs/cck/) in the BOSH documentation. 

1. If you cannot get all VMs running, contact Pivotal Support for assistance. Provide the following information:
	* That you have started this checklist to recover from a power failure on vSphere
	* A list of VMs that are failing
	* Your PCF version

### <a id="check-mysql"></a> Manually Recover PAS MySQL (Clusters Only)

1. In a browser, navigate to the PCF Ops Manager UI and select the **Pivotal Application Service** tile. 

1. Select the **Resource Config** pane. 

1. Review the **INSTANCES** column of the **MySQL Server** job. 

1. If the number of instances is greater than `1`, you must manually recover MySQL by following this procedure: [Recovering From MySQL Cluster Downtime](../mysql/bootstrap-mysql.html). 

## <a id="check-apps"></a> Phase 7: Ensure Apps Hosted on PAS are Running

1. Check the status of an app your company runs on PCF. To do this, run any healthchecks that the app has, or visit the URL of the app to see that it is working. 

1. Push an app to PCF. You can push one of your company's apps, or one of the [Cloud Foundry Sample Applications](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples). 


## <a id="check-hw"></a> Phase 8: Check PCF Healthwatch Dashboard

You can further assess the state of your PCF installation use PCF Healthwatch. For more information, see [Using PCF Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/using.html).
