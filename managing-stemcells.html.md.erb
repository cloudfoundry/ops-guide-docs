This topic explains how to use the Stemcell Library to import and stage stemcells to products.

![The Stemcell Library shows a table with columns headed Product, Required, Deployed, and Staged as well as an Import Stemcell button and a Save Button](images/manage-stemcells.png)

For more conceptual information about floating stemcells and stemcell upgrades, see [Floating Stemcells](../customizing/understanding-stemcells.html).

<p class='note warning'><strong>WARNING:</strong> Some product releases require Xenial stemcells, as listed in <a href="../stemcells/xenial-tiles.html">Tiles Using Xenial Stemcells in PCF</a>. If you are importing and using Xenial stemcells for the first time, see <a href="../../pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html#xenial">Updates for Xenial Stemcell Support</a>.</p>


## <a id="import"></a> Import and Stage a Stemcell

![The Import Stemcell button is floated to the right of the Stemcell Library header next to the Save button](images/import-stemcell.png)

Download the appropriate `.tgz` stemcell file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf), then click **Import Stemcell** to permanently import a stemcell into Ops Manager.

![A modal that appears after importing a stemcell. The modal reads, **Select the products you want to stage**. The modal has a checkbox next to the product name. It also has a dismiss button and an Apply Stemcell to Products button](images/staging-modal.png)

To stage your stemcell to compatible products, enable the products in the **Import Stemcell** dialog. Click **Apply Stemcell to Products** to save your selections. Click **Dismiss** to dismiss the **Import Stemcell** dialog.


## <a id="version"></a> Choose a Stemcell Version

If you have uploaded multiple versions of a stemcell, you can use the dropdown in the **Staged** column to choose which version to use.

You can choose a different version until you deploy. After deployment, older stemcell versions are no longer available.

If the stemcell displays with a green checkmark and the words **Latest stemcell** below the **Staged** dropdown, the stemcell is the latest available version on your host. An outdated stemcell displays **Stemcell out-of-date**.

![Beneath the **Staged** version dropdown, a green checkmark next to the words **Latest stemcell** appears. The stemcell in this image is the latest available version.](images/opsman-latest-stemcell.png)
