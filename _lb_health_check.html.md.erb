Pivotal Application Service (PAS) uses the following properties:
	
* **Unhealthy threshold**: Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that the Gorouter continues to accept connections before shutting down. During this period, the health check reports `unhealthy` to cause load balancers to fail over to other routers. You should set this value greater than or equal to the maximum amount of time it could take your load balancer to consider a router instance unhealthy, given contiguous failed health checks.

* **Healthy threshold**: Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait until declaring the router instance started. This allows an external load balancer time to register the instance as `healthy`.

You can configure these properties from the **Networking** pane. For more information, see the [Configure Networking](../customizing/configure-pas.html#networking) section of the _Configuring PAS_ topic.
