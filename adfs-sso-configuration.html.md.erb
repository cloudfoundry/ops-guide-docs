This topic describes the process of configuring Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) as your identity provider (IdP) in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) and ADFS.


## <a id='idp'></a> Configure SAML Integration in PCF

You can use ADFS as your SAML IdP for Ops Manager and Pivotal Application Service (PAS):

* If you want to use ADFS as your SAML IdP for Ops Manager, do the following:
  * [Configure SAML Integration in Ops Manager](#ops-man)
  * [Configure SAML Integration in ADFS](#adfs)

* If you want to use ADFS as your SAML IdP for PAS, do the following:
  * [Configure SAML Integration in PAS](#pas)
  * [Configure SAML Integration in ADFS](#adfs)

### <a id='ops-man'></a> Configure SAML Integration in Ops Manager

To configure Ops Manager to use ADFS as your SAML IdP, do the following:

1. Download your IdP metadata from `https://YOUR-ADFS-HOSTNAME/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`.

1. Perform the steps in the _Use an Identity Provider_ section of the BOSH Director configuration topic for you IaaS:
  * [Configuring BOSH Director on AWS](../om/aws/config-manual.html#idp)
  * [Configuring BOSH Director on Azure Manually](../om/azure/config-manual.html#idp)
  * [Configuring BOSH Director on GCP](../om/gcp/config-manual.html#idp)
  * [Configuring BOSH Director on OpenStack](../om/openstack/config.html#idp)
  * [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](../om/vsphere/config.html#idp)

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can set up SAML access for Ops Manager during the initial PCF installation or later by navigating to <strong>Settings</strong> in the user menu on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, configuring the <strong>Authentication Method</strong> pane, and then clicking <strong>Review Pending Changes</strong> and <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</p>

### <a id='pas'></a> Configure SAML Integration in PAS

To configure PAS to use ADFS as your SAML IdP, do the following:

1. Download your IdP metadata from `https://YOUR-ADFS-HOSTNAME/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`.

1. Perform the steps in the [Configure PCF as a Service Provider for SAML
](./auth-sso.html#configure-pcf-for-saml) section of the _Configuring Authentication and Enterprise SSO for PAS_ topic.


## <a id='adfs'></a> Configure SAML Integration in ADFS

To designate PCF as your SAML service provider (SP) in ADFS, do the following:

1. Download your SP metadata from `https://login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/saml/metadata`.

1. Open your **ADFS Management** console and add a relying party trust as follows:
  1. Click **Add Relying Party Trust...** in the **Actions** pane.
  1. On the Welcome step, click **Start**.
  1. Select **Import data about the relying party from a file**, import the downloaded SP metadata file, and click **Next**.
  1. Enter a **Display name** for the new relying party trust and click **Next**.

  1. Select **Permit all users to access this relying party** and click **Next**.
  1. Review your settings and click **Next**.
  1. Click **Close** to finish the wizard.

1. Modify your relying party trust as follows:
  1. Double-click the new relying party trust.
  1. Select the **Encryption** tab and click **Remove** to remove the encryption certificate you imported.
  1. In the **Advanced** tab, select **SHA256** for the **Secure hash algorithm**.

1. (Optional) If you are using a self-signed certificate and want to disable CRL checks, do the following:
  1. Open **Windows Powershell** as an Administrator.
  1. Execute the following command: `set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -TargetName "RELYING-PARTY-TRUST" -SigningCertificateRevocationCheck None`

1. To add claim rules for your relying party trust, select your relying party trust and click **Edit Claim Rulesâ€¦**.

1. In the **Issuance Transform Rules** tab, create two claim rules as follows:
  1. Click **Add Rule**.
  1. Select **Send LDAP Attributes as Claims** for **Claim rule template** and click **Next**.
