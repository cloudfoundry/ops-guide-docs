Perform the following steps to configure SSL termination on the Gorouter in <%= vars.first_product_name  %>:

1. Configure your load balancer to pass through TCP requests from the client to the Gorouter.

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile in the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Networking**.

1. For <%= vars.product_name %> deployments on OpenStack or vSphere, choose IP addresses for the Gorouters from the subnet configured for Ops Manager and enter them in the **Router IPs** field. Then configure your load balancer to forward requests for the above domains to these IP addresses. For more information, see [Configuring PAS](../customizing/configure-pas.html#networking).  

1. In the **Certificates and Private Keys for HAProxy and Router** field, click the **Add** button to define at least one certificate keypair for HAProxy and Router. For each certificate keypair that you add, assign a name, enter the PEM-encoded certificate chain and PEM-encoded private key. You can either upload your own certificate or generate an RSA certificate in PAS. For options and instructions on creating a certificate for your wildcard domains, see [Creating a Wildcard Certificate for <%= vars.product_name %> Deployments](../opsguide/security_config.html#create_or_obtain_certs).

1. In the **Minimum version of TLS supported by HAProxy and Router**, select the minimum version of TLS to use in Gorouter communications. The Gorouter uses TLS v1.2 by default. If you need to accommodate clients that use an older version of TLS, select a lower minimum version. For a list of TLS ciphers supported by the Gorouter, see [Cipher Suites](#ciphers). 

1. Under **HAProxy forwards requests to Router over TLS**, select **Disable**.

1. If you want to use a specific set of TLS ciphers for the Gorouter, configure **TLS Cipher Suites for Router**. Enter an ordered, colon-separated list of TLS cipher suites in the OpenSSL format. For example, if you have selected support for an earlier version of TLS, you can enter cipher suites supported by this version. For a list of TLS ciphers supported by the Gorouter, see [Cipher Suites](#ciphers). Otherwise, leave the default values in this field. 

1. (Optional) If you are not using SSL encryption or if you are using self-signed certificates, you can select **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment**. Selecting this checkbox also disables SSL verification for route services. 
  <p class="note">Use this checkbox only for development and testing environments. Do not select it for production environments.</p> 
  
1. (Optional) If you do not want the Gorouter to accept any non-encrypted HTTP traffic, select the **Disable HTTP on HAProxy and Router** checkbox. 

1. In the **Configure the CF Router support for the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header** field, select the third option, **Strip the XFCC header when present and set it to the client certificate**.
 
1. Click **Save**.

1. In the PAS tile, click **Resource Config**. 

1. In the **Instances** drop down for the **HAProxy** job, select `0` instances.

1. Click **Save**.
