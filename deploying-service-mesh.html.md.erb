This topic describes how to deploy service mesh for Pivotal Application Service (PAS).

For more information about service mesh, see [Service Mesh (Beta)](../adminguide/service-mesh.html).

## <a id="configuring-pas"></a> Enable in PAS

To deploy service mesh, configure PAS as follows:

1. Navigate to the **Networking - Service Mesh** pane of the PAS tile. 
	![Service Mesh](service-mesh.png)

1. Under **Service Mesh (Beta)**, select **Enable**. 

1. For **IP Addresses for Ingress Router**, do the following depending on your IaaS:
	* **vSphere**: Enter static IPs for the Istio Routers. You must configure your load balancer with these IPs as well. 
	* **Other**: Leave this field blank. 

1. For **Ingress Router TLS Keypairs**, complete the following fields. You can add more than one keypair if desired using the **Add** button.
	* **Name**: Enter a name for the keypair. 
	* **Certificate and Private Key for Istio Router**: Enter the Private key and certificate for TLS handshakes with clients. These must be in PEM block format. 

1. Click **Save**. 

## <a id="create-load-balancer"></a> Create a Load Balancer

To configure a load balancer for service mesh, do the following. The exact procedure varies by IaaS. 

1. Create a load balancer with the following:
	* A static IP
	* Health check port `8002` and path `/healthcheck`
	* Firewall rules to allow the following:
		* HTTP on port `80`
		* HTTP on port `8002`
		* TLS on port `443`

1. Navigate to your DNS provider and create a DNS name, `*.mesh.YOUR-CF-APPS-DOMAIN`, that resolves to the IP of the load balancer. This is the default domain for service mesh and it is not configurable.  

## <a id="resource-config"></a> Add Load Balancer to Resource Config

If your deployment is on an IaaS other than vSphere, do the following after you create your load balancer:

1. Navigate to the **Resource Config** pane of the PAS tile. 

1. In the **Load Balancer** column of the **istio-router** row, enter the name of the load balancer you created. 

1. Click **Apply Changes**.
