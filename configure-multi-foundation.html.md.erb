This topic describes how to configure **Apps Manager** to display information from multiple foundations.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Configuring multi-foundation support in Apps Manager allows you to search, view, and manage orgs, spaces, apps, and service instances across multiple foundations from a single interface.

## <a id="configure"></a> Configure Multi-Foundation Support

This section describes how to configure multi-foundation support in Apps Manager. 

To configure multi-foundation support, do the following:
1. Configure PAS. See [Configure PAS](#pas).
1. Add Redirects in UAA. See [Add Redirects in UAA](#redirects).
1. Add Trusted Certificate Authorities. See [Add Trusted Certificate Authorities](#certificates).
1. (Optional) Configure the SAML Identity Provider. See [(Optional) Configure the SAML Identity Provider](#saml).

### <a id="pas"> Configure PAS

This section describes how to configure PAS on a foundation to enable multi-foundation support in Apps Manager.

To configure multi-foundation support in Apps Manager, do the following: 

1. In the PAS tile of one of your foundations, select **Apps Manager**. The following image shows the **Apps Manager** page.
    ![There is a heading at the top of the Apps Manager page that says, Configure Apps Manager. There are several fields on the Apps Manager page. The Multi-foundation Configuration field is the last field on the page. A Save button is at the bottom of the page.](images/multi-foundation-apps-man-configuration.png)

1. For **Multi-foundation Configuration (BETA)**, enter a JSON object for each additional foundation that you want to manage. Use the following format:
	```json
	{
	  "FOUNDATION_NAME": {
	    "ccUrl": "https://api.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
	    "systemDomain": "FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
	    "usageServiceUrl": "https://app-usage.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
	    "invitationsServiceUrl": "https://p-invitations.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
	    "logoutUrl": "https://login.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com/logout.do",
	    "metricsUrl": "https://metrics.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com",
	    "uaaUrl": "https://login.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com"
	  },
	}
	```
	Where:
	- `FOUNDATION_NAME` is a name for the foundation.
	- `FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN` is the system domain of the foundation. You can find this value in the **Domains** pane of the PAS tile for the foundation. 
	- `metricsUrl` is optional. Provide a value for this field if PCF Metrics is installed on the foundation.

### <a id="redirects"></a> Add Redirects in UAA

On the `apps_manager_js` client of each additional foundation, add a redirect URI to the Apps Manager URL of the current foundation. The redirect allows Apps Manager on the current foundation to redirect to the other foundations and back when you authenticate with UAA. For more information about UAA clients and configuring valid redirect URIs, see [Client.redirect-uri](../uaa/uaa-concepts.html#redirect-uri).

In UAA, the `apps_manager_js` client should have A's Apps Manager URL
(https://apps.a-foundation-system-domain.com) as a valid redirect URI. 

To add redirects in UAA, do the following on each foundation:
1. Install the UAA CLI. See [CloudFoundry UAA Command Line Client](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac) in GitHub.
1. Record the UAA admin client credentials password: 
	1. In the PAS tile **Credentials** tab, for **Admin Client Credentials**, click **Link to Credentials**.
	1. Record the value in the `password` field.
1. Use the following command to generate a token for the UAA admin client:
    ```bash
    uaac target uaa.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com
    uaac token client get admin -s ADMIN_CLIENT_PASSWORD
    ```
    Where:
    - `FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN` is the system domain of the foundation.
    - `ADMIN_CLIENT_PASSWORD` is the **Admin Client Credentials** password you recorded in the previous step.
1. Record the UAA redirect URIs. Use the following command to view the redirect URIs from the UAA `apps_manager_js` client:
    ```bash
    uaac client get apps_manager_js
    ```
1. Run the following command to update the `apps_manager_js` client with the Apps Manager URL from the current foundation.
    ```bash
    uaac client update apps_manager_js --redirect_uri \
        'PREVIOUS_REDIRECT_URIS,https://apps.FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN.com/**'
    ```
    Where: 
    - `PREVIOUS_REDIRECT_URIS` is one or more redirect URIs from the UAA `apps_manager_js` on the foundation.
    - `FOUNDATION_SYSTEM_DOMAIN` is the system domain of the current foundation.

### <a id="certificates"></a> Add Trusted Certificate Authorities

Apps Manager must be able to validate the Certificate Authorities (CAs) used by all foundations. 

If any foundation uses a certificate for TLS termination that is not signed by a globally-trusted CA, add the CA that signed the TLS
certificate as a trusted certificate on the foundation on which you enabled multi-foundation support. 

For more information about adding trusted certificates to a foundation, see [Setting Trusted Certificates](../customizing/trusted-certificates.html).

### <a id="saml"></a> (Optional) Configure the SAML Identity Provider

Pivotal recommends that all foundations use the same external SAML identity provider. This allows Apps Manager to automatically authenticate with the identity provider. 

To configure all foundations to use the same SAML identity provider, do the following:

1. On each foundation, open the PAS tile and click **UAA**. 
1. On the **UAA** pane, locate **Provider Name**. Verify that all foundations use the same value for **Provider Name**.

For more information on UAA and identity providers, see [Identity Providers in
UAA](../uaa/identity-providers.html)

For more information on how to setup identity providers in UAA, see [Adding Existing SAML or
LDAP Users to a PCF Deployment](../opsguide/external-user-management.html)
