title: Ongoing Operations
owner: <%= vars.product_name %> Documentation
---

This topic describs how to perform routine operations on a running <%= vars.first_product_name  %> platform.


##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

Ongoing operations are procedures that <%= vars.product_name %> operators routinely perform to keep the platform working as it should, or to change how it works if the platform needs to do something new or has a problem.

Examples include:

* Performing <%= vars.product_name %> upgrades
* Making changes to your IaaS and external components
* Monitoring platform health, checking logs, and generating usage reports
* Tuning the platform to eliminate bottlenecks or increase capacity
* Giving developers access to new software services, stacks, and app capabilities
* Backing up and restoring the platform

In addition to these tasks, <%= vars.product_name %> operators also routinely perform Day 2 configurations to configure or change platform features and integrations even well past Day 2. For more information, see [Day 2 Configurations](../customizing/day2.html).
