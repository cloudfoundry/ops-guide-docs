The API endpoint for your Pivotal Application Service (PAS) deployment, its target URL, is the API endpoint of the deployment's Cloud Controller. Find your Cloud Controller API endpoint by consulting your cloud operator, from the Apps Manager, or from the command line.

Log in to the Apps Manager for your PAS instance, then click **Tools** in the left navigation panel.
The **Getting Started** section of the Tools page shows your API endpoint.
