title: Auditing User Activity in Ops Manager
owner: Ops Man
---

This topic describes how operators can audit user activity in Ops Manager. The sections in this topic define the relevant logs for auditing user activity and describe how to access and forward the logs.


## <a id ='overview'></a> Overview

You can audit user activity in Ops Manager to help improve security practices for your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) environment. Auditing user activity also helps you ensure that your environment is compliant with existing security standards. 

For example, you can view the timestamp of any requests made in the Ops Man UI as well as the username of the user that made the request.

You can find relevant information for auditing user activity in Ops Manager in the following Ops Manager logs:

* SSH login logs. See [Logs for Auditing User Activity](#logs).
* UAA login and failed UAA login logs. See [Logs for Auditing User Activity](#logs).
* The Ops Manager `audit_log.txt` file. See [Audit Logs Text File](audit-logs-text-file).


## <a id='access-logs'></a> Access Logs on the Ops Manager VM

You can access logs for auditing user activity by logging on to the Ops Manager VM using SSH. 

To access logs for auditing user activity, do the following:

1. SSH onto the Ops Manager VM using your private SSH key. 

1. Navigate to the location of the logs and open or preview the log file. For example, to view the `audit_log.txt` file, run the following command:

	```
	cat /var/log/opsmanager/audit_log.txt
	```


## <a id='logs'></a> Logs for Auditing User Activity

The following table describes the types of user actions that you can audit with logs. The table also lists the location of the logs. 

For information about how to access the logs in the following table, see [Access Logs on the Ops Manager VM](#access-logs).

## <a id='audit-logs-text-file'></a> Audit Logs Text File

The Ops Manager `audit_log.txt` file includes metadata about actions taken by users in the Ops Manager app in JSON format.

The following is an example of the content in the `audit_log.txt` file:

```
{
	"timestamp":"2019-07-13T00:43:08.783+00:00",
	"component":"Ops Manager 2.7.0-build.87",
	"component_scheme":"https",

	"component_port":443,
	"result":200,
	"target":"/proxy_settings",
	"event_type":"PUT",
	"origination":"123.456.789",
	"user_identification":"admin",
	"uaa_authentication_mechanism":"uaa"
}	
```

The following table describes the properties in the `audit_log.txt` file. It also provides example values for each property.

## <a id='forward-syslog'></a> Forward Logs

You can forward some Ops Manager logs using syslog forwarding. This allows you to forward logs to a syslog server or other third-party destination for storage and analysis. 

The following logs contain relevant information for auditing user activity and can be forwarded using syslog forwarding:

* `uaa.out`
* `audit_log.txt`

For more information about syslog forwarding in Ops Manager, see the [Syslog](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/pcf-interface.html#syslog) section in the _Using the Ops Manager Interface_ topic.
