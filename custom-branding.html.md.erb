This topic describes how Pivotal Cloud Foundry operators can visually brand Apps Manager by changing certain text, colors, and images of the interface. Developers view the customized interface when logging in, creating an account, resetting a password, or using Apps Manager.

Operators customize Apps Manager by configuring the **Custom Branding** and **Apps Manager Config** pages of the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile.

1. For **Square Logo**, enter a Base64-encoded URL string for a PNG image to use in the Apps Manager header and in places that require a smaller logo. For example, `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0...`. If left blank, the image defaults to the Pivotal Logo.
1. For **Favicon**, enter a Base64-encoded URL string for a PNG image to use as your favicon. For example, `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0...`. If left blank, the image defaults to the Pivotal Logo.
1. For **Footer Text**, enter a string to be displayed as the footer. If left blank, the footer text defaults to **Pivotal Software Inc. All rights reserved.**.
1. To add up to three footer links that appear to the right of the footer text, complete the following steps:
	* Click **Add**.
	* For **Link text**, enter a label for the link.
	* For **Url**, enter an external or relative URL. For example, `http://docs.pivotal.io` or `/tools.html`.
	
1. For special notification purposes such as governmental or restricted usage, use the Classification fields to create a special Header and Footer. Enter values in the following fields:
    * For **Classification Header/Footer Background Color**, enter the hexadecimal code for the desired background color of the header and footer.
	* For **Classification Header/Footer Text Color**, enter the hexadecimal code for the desired color of header and footer text.
	* For **Classification Header Content**, enter content for the header in either plain text or HTML. If you enter HTML content, eliminate white spaces and new lines. If you do not provide any content, the custom header will not appear.
	* For **Classification Footer Content**, enter content for the footer in either plain text or HTML. If you enter HTML content, eliminate white spaces and new lines. If you do not provide any content, the custom footer will not appear. The Classification footer appears below the normal footer, which you can customize in the **Footer Text** and  **Footer Links** fields.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Header and Footer do not appear on the <a href="../concepts/architecture/uaa.html">User Account and Authentication (UAA)</a> login page.</p>

## <a id='apps-man'></a>Apps Manager Config Page

1. In a browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Ops Manager and log in.
1. Click **Pivotal Application Service**.
1. Click the **Apps Manager Config** tab.

	<%= image_tag 'config-apps-man.png' %>

1. For **Product Name**, enter text to replace **Apps Manager** in the header and the title of Apps Manager. This text defaults to **Apps Manager** if left blank.
1. For **Marketplace Name**, enter text to replace the header in the Marketplace pages. This text defaults to **Marketplace** if left blank.
1. By default, Apps Manager includes three sidebar links: **Marketplace**, **Docs**, and **Tools**. You can edit existing sidebar links by clicking the name of the link and editing the **Link text** and **Url** fields. Or, you can remove the link by clicking the trash icon next to its name. If you want to add a new sidebar link, click **Add** and complete the **Link text** and **Url** fields.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Removing any of the default links will remove them from the sidebar for all users.</p>


1. (Optional) Enter your desired **Apps Manager Memory Usage** in MBs. The minimum number you can enter is `128`.


1. (Optional) Enter your desired **Invitations Memory Usage** in MBs. This is the memory
limit used to deploy the Invitations app. The minimum number you can enter is `256`.


1. The **Apps Manager Polling Interval** field provides a temporary fix if Apps Manager usage degrades Cloud Controller response times. In this case, you can use this field to reduce the load on the Cloud Controller and ensure Apps Manager remains available while you troubleshoot the Cloud Controller. Pivotal recommends that you do not keep this field modified as a long term fix because it can degrade Apps Manager performance. You can optionally do the following:	
	* Increase the polling interval above the default of `30` seconds. 
		<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you enter a value between <code>0</code> and <code>30</code>, the field is automatically set to <code>30</code>.</p>
	* Disable polling by entering `0`. This stops Apps Manager from refreshing data automatically, but users can update displayed data by reloading Apps Manager manually.

1. The **App Details Polling Interval** field provides an additional way to reduce the load on the Cloud Controller when the **Apps Manager Polling Interval** field is not sufficient. This field controls the rate at which Apps Manager polls for data when a user views the **Overview** page of an app. Pivotal recommends that you do not keep this field modified as a long term fix because it can degrade Apps Manager performance. You can optionally do the following:
	* Increase the polling interval above the default of `10` seconds. 
		<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you enter a value between <code>0</code> and <code>30</code>, the field is automatically set to <code>10</code>.</p>
	* Disable polling by entering `0`.  This stops Apps Manager from refreshing data automatically, but users can update displayed data by reloading Apps Manager manually.
